# Electricity Market Auction Modelling 

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis titled **"Electricity Market Design: A Comparison of Ancillary Services Procurement Archetypes Around the Globe and Their Effectiveness in Reducing System Cost"**. The project focuses on analysing existing frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) procurement mechanisms in electricity markets. This code replicates the behaviour of three simple archetypes for power and FCAS procurement.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, install the dependencies found on the requirements.txt file inside a conda environment
